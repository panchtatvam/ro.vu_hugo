## Work on Things You Care About.
- Break your day down into small events or tasks, make a mental note note about whether or not you enjoyed each one
-I you cannot identify any items, (or if all the items identified are considered negative experiences) then look critically at your current role.

## Define Goals for Yourself. 
- Sshare your goals with your colleagues or supervisor. They will learn what is important to you, be interested to support you, keep an eye out for you.
- Define goals you want to accomplish in short term (week, month) and long term

## Define Productivity for Yourself. 
- Feel satisfaction that your work was meaninful
- Create an accomplishment list - mention-worthy. Creates a better understanding of yourself, and what you feel happy and productive. 

##  Establish Routine and Environment. 
- Challenge: Your working environment, or lack of a routine, can destabilize the workday, and thus your productivity. 
* Pay attention to the lighting, noise level, and comfort of a work space
* If you find yourself distracted by anything, change your environment. Habitual repetition by way of thinking about your environment or making explicit choices can lead to the establishment of longer-term habits. The more that you are able to repeat a behavior in a specific environment, the more likely it is to feel effortless.
* Creating a clear separation between times when you are working, and times when you are not. 
* Include activities for your personal well-being (exercise, time with family, relaxation)

## Take Responsibility for Your Work. 

Challenges: 
If you are in a role that provides user-support, work on a team, or otherwise have a list of tasks set out for you, there is a tendency to be passive. 

Examples:
- Small annoyances that affect people on a regular basis

Share ideas & projects with your supervisor and team. Establishes trust.

Decide what is important. Crate a plan to do it. Execute the plan.

Outcomes
- Independence
- New skills
- Feeling of ownership over work
- Solidifies how your team thinks about and consequently treats you


Your supervisor should not require tracking software to keep abreast of your every move because they have confidence and trust in you.


## Take Responsibility for Human Connection. 


Goal: 
- Feel included and happy

Challenges:
- Social isolation --> Feelings of Disconnected, lonely --> exhaustion

When newly remote, it is common to place the burden of connection on your team. If your team is not remote first,11 it is even more unlikely that there are established protocols and best practices for how to make you feel included and happy. Many of us learn this the hard way right at the offset of going remote. If we become disconnected from our immediate or even open source communities, it can feel terribly lonely and have direct impact on our well-being.9,34 In fact, social-isolation or exhaustion alone can trigger this same loneliness.32 In this situation, it is important to identify that there is a problem, namely lack of human connection, and figure out the kinds of human connection that are meaningful to you. You might first find comfort in the fact that feeling lonely is more common than you might think.36 You might then seek out human connection. Seeking human connection means attending virtual workshops, conference calls, or looking around for regular meetings that you could participate in. If you are looking for more one-on-one human interaction, you might see if anyone would be interested in having a virtual coffee a few times a month, or a virtual "happy hour" to involve others. The choice of group is up to you. While it is reasonable to consider your colleagues at work, what you are missing might be connection to friends or family, and so a regularly scheduled family meeting or even meeting online to play a game could be a regular event. In the context of work, you can also use the trick of sharing your work to pursue human connection. If you share progress on your projects on social media or Slack, it likely will open lines of communication with others interested in your work. Whatever your strategy, by changing your environment you can feel less lonely.38 As a remote worker you might live in isolation, but you do not need to work in it.




## Practice Empathetic Review. 
Software engineering requires a lot of technical communication. People have different expectations and incentive structures. Good 
- [Communication]({{< ref "communication" >}} "communication")

Communication improves productivity.


,2,27 and having good productivity can further make you a better, less adversarial communicator.19 For example, if you encounter a maintainer of a repository seeming curt or mean, you might consider the responsibility on their shoulders to maintain the software, the number of other issues or pull requests they need to review, and that they are working in free time. The maintainer is likely to be in a stressful role. You might also consider cultural differences in communication--it could be that a succinct response is more common in their community or culture. When you take these factors into account, a response that you might have reacted with that is defensive, confrontational, or otherwise aggressive, might be adjusted to have kindness, and further, be productive by asking how you might help. Arguably, the quality of communication on the level of an organization comes down to the quality of the individuals' communication within it. Better communication leads to positive outcomes that range from addressing an issue to solving a problem, or simply feeling involved with decision making.15 No interaction is too small to practice good communication. Practicing empathetic development means introducing yourself, describing the issue or change clearly, and making it easy for the other party to reproduce. By setting an example, you will not only influence the others involved in the work at hand, but also set an example for the immediate community and larger community of software engineers.
Have Self-Compassion. You can do your best to define personal goals, establish routine, and do meaningful work that feels productive, but this does not always mean that you finish the day and feel that you were successful. This is where self-compassiond and mindfulness4 are important, as they have been shown to have positive impact on mental health and well-being.3 Self-compassion can broadly be defined as being mindful and forgiving to yourself.16 Having self-compassion means looking back on the experience of a day, and not egging yourself for everything that was not perfect. It is just a given that every day will not feel productive. You might try new routines that do not work for you. Instead of thinking negatively, you might consider that establishing your routine, or figuring out a hard problem, is a work in progress, and there is no real state of failure because you wake up and try again. I have found that it helps to try to imagine myself as another person. If someone else approached me with the same experiences and negative thoughts, how would I comfort them? It is very likely that I would react with compassion, and that is the same compassion that I must find for myself. If the source of criticism comes from an external source, although you cannot control other people, you can choose to respond thoughtfully, with kindness, and try to find humor in the situation. However, obviously if someone is in violation of some code of conduct, you should report it, and not absorb it quietly. Thus, self-compassion also means knowing when to stand up for yourself and say something. This advice is especially pertinent for women and other minorities in the work force who might experience subtle inequality or microaggressions.e
