title: Responding to Texts
---

Never feel rushed to respond to my texts. 

Life happens outside of the phone. Many friends go days, weeks and months between texts. I prefer a thoughtful "present" text over a rushed impersonal one.

If you are feeling rushed to respond to texts, or apologizing for delays - Listen to your subconscious, find out where the urgency is coming from, and see if you can untangle yourself. Often, these obligations are completely in our head. Learn how to understanding, communicate, and enforce your boundaries to others in your life.
