never knowing what other person wants, or who you should be
never understanding "why I cant be me?"

## Contempt
Contempt is dangerous to a relationship. If you want a relationship to last, never tolerate contempt from either person.
If a person says something contemptuous, the other person calls it out immediately. Because both people have the understanding about contempt, use as escape hatch to conflict. Cut things off before they become hurtful.
