Stressing out like this is worse thank smoking, drinking, or drugs

You might find the girl of your dreams. You might not. Both options are better than being with someone you know is NOT.

There is no rule in life that says, "You're not allowed to feel the way you feel"

You care so much about what she thinks and feels, don't you think you deserve the same?
Aren't your feelings and thoughts as real as others?

How honest do you think she is with her thoughts and feelings? How would things fare if you were broke for example?

# Sliding
"Whenever I kicked the can down the road, I regretted the lost time badly"

Future = doesn't look so good
Present = doesn't look so good
past = got here somehow...

# Letting go
LET GO. tell yourself that every day. Where has worrying over shit gotten me? No where.
