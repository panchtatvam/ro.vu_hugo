The Ages of Globalization -Jeffrey Sachs. 
- Kama: "Provides so much context and foundation for understanding what is happening in our world. It’s history, but the narratives he provides and threads he weaves together are next level. I gravitate to the macro, so this was especially nerd boner inducing for me." (LOL Kama -JRO)

World War Z
- Kama: "I have watched the movie a thousand times and finally picked up the book. It is a collection of recollections on which the movie is based. Fantastic shit, and if you still think you’re having a bad day after, you weren’t paying attention."
    
Good Omens by Gaiman and Pratchett
- Kama: Just delightful in every conceivable way.
        
Decameron by Boccaccio. 
- Kama: "You would never guess it was written in the 1300’s. The plague section is gruesome, and the stories hold up brilliantly. That’s my fave from the Classics bin."

Predictably Irrational
- Daniella: "I love behavioral economics and this is such a fascinating non-fiction read. I blew through it and I think about it to this day."

High Performance Habits
- Daniella: "I listened to this for the first time on audiotape last year and I think about this one line a lot ‘if you leave your growth to randomness you’re destined for mediocrity""

The Fran Lebowitz Reader
- Daniella: "If I’m on a desert island I think I’d want a laugh. This one made me laugh aloud"

For Those I Loved -Martin gray

The Forty Rules of Love -Elif Shafak
- Saygin: "Rumi's life as if you're there with him - feeling his love and suffering and what he's been through"

Don Quixote
- Stu: "The humor and self-awareness feels like a contemporary novel but it was written hundreds of years ago. Uses humor and absurdity to comment on life’s pursuits."

Unbearable Lightness of Being
- Stu: "Impeccable job at breaking down a guy’s different relationships, and capturing the "we’ve all thought that" type of inner monologues. Quick read."
