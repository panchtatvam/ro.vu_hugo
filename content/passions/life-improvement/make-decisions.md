## Considerations
- Have I done this before? If not, can I learn something from it?
- Can I spend only a little time on it before committing further?
- Can I meet interesting people by doing this activity?
- Is this something most people like me would say no to? Going against the "crowd wisdom" is an underrated way to gain novel insights.
- Can I stop doing it if I don't like it? Avoids committing long-term to things that don't work out.


## Deciding 
1. List out
    - Situation & Context
    - Goals + "5 Whys"
    - Challenges, blockers, concerns
        - Assuptions --> Open Questions -> Who can answer?
    - Costs: Time, money, attention
    - People / Who's involved
    - Important Dates
    - Choices
        - Ask someone - maybe there are other choices
        - Reduce to 3 choices
2. Evaluate Choices. For each choice:
    - Pros / Benefits
        - Satisficing vs Maximizing
    - Cons / Drawbacks
    - nth-order thinking
        - "and then...", "results in..."
    - Outcomes
        - What's the impact for different time ranges
            - Tomorrow
            - Next week
            - Next month
            - Next year
            - 5 years
            - Looking back on death bed
        - How does this affect other people you care about in your life?
            - Partner, family, friends, colleagues
    - Emotions
        - Which choice / outcome would be the most satisfying looking back?
3. Decide
    - Quick
        - Timebox to 10 min or 1 hour
        - Involve 3 trusted people
    - Slow
        - Sleep on it. Journal at the beginning & end of a day to catch different moves
        - "Wear the hat" for a day -- Mentally commit to choice for a day, and fully imagine it. Plan it out. Picture the process. Write down all the actions, people, resources invoved. The next day, mentally commit to the other choice. 
    - Emotions: Evaluate your emotions & subconscious honestly. How do you FEEL about the choice and why?
4. Review
- Schedule retrospective on calendar.
    - Event title: "Decision review: <Decision> (YYYY-MM-DD)"
    - Event Date: Create events for 1 week, 1 month, 1 year
    - Event Notes: 
        - Decision Page in {{< ref "journal-planner" >}}
- Learn
    - Situation, decision, dates
    - What did we learn?
