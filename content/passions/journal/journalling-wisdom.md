## Daily Prompts
What do I need? 
What do I want? 
Is what I'm doing serving me? 
Is there a reason I am not doing things that have been on my list for weeks?

## Monthly prompts
This month's wins
Things to change
Favorite memories
Start/Stop/Continue

## Planner
insights gleaned from emotional journaling will be translated to action steps and placed in my goals list.
