## Planner
insights gleaned from emotional journaling will be translated to action steps and placed in my goals list.

pick one area of life (Career, Relationships, Home, Hobbies, etc) each month and make 1-2 large monthly goals related to that, and several smaller weekly goals. That's one way to make something as nebulous as "intentions" a little more concrete.
