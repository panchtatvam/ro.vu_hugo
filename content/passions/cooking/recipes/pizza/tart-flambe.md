Authorized ingredients are lardons (bacon), onions, cheese (like gruyère or Munster), and maybe mushrooms.

The cream is usually made with fromage blanc and crème fraîche + salt, pepper and nutmeg.

The dough is pretty simple, no yeast, no rise. You can easily find a recipe (flour, water, oil). The key is to make it very thin.

Fromage blanc can be substituted by Greek yogurt (whole). And if you cannot find crème fraîche you can use sour cream.
