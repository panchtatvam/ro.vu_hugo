# Ingredients

- ¼ cup crème fraîche
- ⅓ cup fromage blanc
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- ⅞ cup/110 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons olive oil
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 strips/100 grams thick-cut smoked bacon, finely diced (about 2/3 cup)
- ⅓ cup finely chopped white onion


# Equipment

- Parchment paper
- Pizza stone (or baking sheet)
- Rimmed baking sheet
- Medium bowl
- Oven
- Wisk or fork
- Rolling pin

# Process

- Place pizza stone topped with a baking sheet or if you don’t have a stone, just place the baking sheet on the oven rack and heat the oven to 425 degrees.
- In a medium bowl, combine crème fraîche, fromage blanc, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pepper. Set aside while you make the dough.
- In a separate medium bowl, whisk to combine flour, baking powder and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.
- In a small bowl, whisk to combine olive oil, egg yolk and 1/4 cup water. Add to dry ingredients and use a fork to combine until it creates a shaggy dough.
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 1 minute, until the dough is uniform and elastic. (Flour your hands as necessary to keep the dough from sticking.)
- Roll out dough to a 12-inch round, then transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet without a rim (or use an overturned rimmed baking pan).
- Spread fromage blanc mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border along the edges. Sprinkle bacon and onions over fromage blanc.
- Slide tart, still on parchment paper, off baking sheet and directly onto baking sheet in oven.
- Bake until top is beginning to brown, and sides are golden and crispy, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and slide off parchment paper to serving platter.
- Serve warm.

# Notes


Typical ingredients are lardons (bacon), onions, cheese (like gruyère or Munster), and maybe mushrooms.

The cream is usually made with fromage blanc and crème fraîche + salt, pepper and nutmeg.

The dough is pretty simple, no yeast, no rise. You can easily find a recipe (flour, water, oil). The key is to make it very thin.

Fromage blanc can be substituted by Greek yogurt (whole). And if you cannot find crème fraîche you can use sour cream.
