### Check out 
* Screencasting
	* OBS


## Guidance/advice
* Speak slowly
* Use active voice. Rather than "the lid is turned clockwise,” it is better to say "turn the lid clockwise."
* make sure you explain exactly what is seen in the video
* Preview with a condensed version of task
* use of the pronouns “I”, “we” and “you”
* Begin with stating the goal or the purpose of the instruction and follow with the precise steps that are required for a successful outcome. The steps should be logical and streamlined.
* Draw attention to the connection between actions of the user and reactions of the system or product
* Try to limit the length of your video to 1 minute; between 2-10min
* Who is your audience, what are their probems, why watch
* dont go for perfect


## Ideas
hire voice artist
hire someone to transcribe caption
gif


Structures
* Emotional Pull – Gain viewer’s attention with emotion
* Priming – Ready the viewer with topic background information
